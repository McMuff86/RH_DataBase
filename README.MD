# Rhino-Supabase Plugin

## Introduction
This plugin for Rhino enables the management of parts and drawings through a Supabase database. It offers an intuitive user interface, allowing users to select and insert parts into their Rhino projects. The plugin is built on **RhinoCommon** and **Eto.Forms**. A future extension to include a product configurator is planned.

## Requirements
- **Rhino 3D Software**: Required for plugin integration.
- **.NET Framework**: Serves as the development foundation.
- **Nuget Package Manager**: Used to install necessary libraries.

## Installation
1. **Install Nuget Packages**:
   - `RhinoCommon`: For Rhino plugin development.
   - `Eto.Forms`: For creating the user interface.
   - `Supabase`: For establishing the database connection.
2. Install a platform-specific Eto.Forms package, e.g., `Eto.Platform.Wpf` for Windows.

## Configuration
1. **Set up Supabase Project**:
   - Create a project in Supabase.
   - Note the **Project URL** and **Public Key**.
2. **Define Data Models**:
   - Create C# classes for parts and drawings using `[Table]` and `[Column]` attributes.
3. **Initialize Supabase Client**:
   - Configure the client in your code using the Project URL and Public Key.

## Usage
1. Launch Rhino and load the plugin.
2. Access the user interface through the plugin menu.
3. Connect to the Supabase database.
4. Select parts from the list and insert them into your Rhino project.

## Development Notes
- **RhinoCommon**: Refer to the [RhinoCommon Documentation](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinocommon/) for plugin development details.
- **Eto.Forms**: See the [Eto.Forms Wiki](https://github.com/picoe/Eto/wiki) for UI development guidance.
- **Supabase C#**: The library is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-csharp).

## Database Integration and Development Tools
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: This project uses MCP Server for Cursor IDE to interact with the Supabase database directly from the development environment.
- **Supabase Documentation**: The following documentation resources are used for database integration:
  - [Supabase API Overview](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api)
  - [API Quickstart](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/quickstart)
  - [Generating Types](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/rest/generating-types)
  - [SQL to REST Conversion](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/sql-to-rest)
  - [Creating API Routes](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/creating-routes)
  - [API Keys Management](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/api-keys)
  - [Securing Your API](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/securing-your-api)
  - [Database Tables](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/tables)
  - [Working with Arrays](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/arrays)
  - [Postgres Indexes](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes)

## Database Setup and Testing
The plugin has built-in functionality for testing the database connection and setting up necessary tables:
- On plugin startup, it automatically tests the connection to the Supabase database
- If tables don't exist yet, it attempts to create them by adding sample data
- A test command `TestDatabaseConnection` is available to manually verify the database connection

## Future Extensions
- **Product Configurator**: Automatic selection and insertion of components from the database into Rhino.

# Project Structure and Code Clarity
To keep the code in the main project folder clear and organized, the following structure is implemented:

- **Models/**: Data models (e.g., parts, drawings).
- **Views/**: UI components.
- **Controllers/**: Control logic.
- **Services/**: Services (e.g., database connection).
- **Config/**: Configuration files.
- **Tests/**: Unit tests.

### Measures for Clarity
- **Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful names for classes and methods.
- **Modularity**: Employ small, reusable code modules.
- **Comments**: Include explanations within the code.
- **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes.
- **Tests**: Implement unit tests for stability.
- **Dependencies**: Manage via Nuget.
- **Logging**: Incorporate error and event logging.

## What's Missing to Maximize the Plugin's Usefulness?
To enhance the Rhino-Supabase Plugin and ensure it provides maximum benefit to users, the following features and improvements could be added:

- **User Authentication**:
  - Implement a login system to secure access to the Supabase database, ensuring only authorized users can view or modify data.
  
- **Database Backups**:
  - Add support for automatic or manual backups of the Supabase database to prevent data loss and improve reliability.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Introduce robust error handling with user-friendly notifications to help users troubleshoot issues effectively.

- **User Documentation**:
  - Provide detailed guides and tutorials for end-users, covering installation, configuration, and usage to improve accessibility and adoption.

- **Internationalization**:
  - Add multi-language support in the user interface to cater to a global audience.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Optimize data queries and storage processes to enhance the plugin's speed and efficiency, especially for large datasets.

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Develop tests to verify the interaction between Rhino and the Supabase database, ensuring seamless functionality.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Set up automated builds and testing through a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline to streamline development and ensure consistent quality.

These additions would significantly improve the plugin's security, usability, reliability, and scalability, making it a more powerful tool for Rhino users managing parts and drawings via Supabase.
